# Implementing a dynamic instruction scheduling simulator based on Tomasulo’s algorithm

University of Central Florida, Department of Computer Science, CDA 5106: Fall 2020

Machine Problem 3: Dynamic Instruction Scheduling

In this project, you will construct a simulator for an out-of-order superscalar processor based on Tomasulo’s algorithm that fetches, dispatches, and issues N instructions per cycle. Only the dynamic scheduling mechanism will be modeled in detail, i.e., perfect caches and perfect branch prediction are assumed.

The problem description can be found in "Instructions.pdf" and the results of the simulation is in "report.pdf"

DynamicInstructionSchedulingExperiments folder contains code that automates running multiple runs and report the results in csv file
